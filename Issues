In the pdf it is  mentioned that the code should follow a microservice architecture. While I understand the benefits of microservices, I must admit that I am more comfortable with other architectural patterns such as MVC or Clean Architecture. Given this, I wanted to inquire if it would be acceptable to develop my solution using either MVC or Clean Architecture instead of microservices.

Your guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated, as it will help me align my approach with the hackathon's requirements.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
